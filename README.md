# Web_scrapper_with_sheduler
my web scraping program, extracts top news articles from Google News and stores them in a MongoDB database. I used Selenium to automate the extraction of headlines, article URLs, and images. The program processes the scraped data and ensures no duplicate entries by checking existing records before storing them. I implemented logging and error-handling to track execution and prevent failures. My approach is modular, with each module performing a specific task, and the task_orchestrator script coordinating their execution. Finally, I set up a windows task_scheduler to automatically run the task orchestrator script at every day at 23:55.
